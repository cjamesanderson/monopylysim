Monopoly player movement simulator

This is software used to generate the empirical probabilities used in my blog post <a href="https://cjamesanderson.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/everything-you-never-needed-to-know-about-monopoly-with-charts/">here.</a>

To run a simulation:
<ol>
  <li>Create a Simulator instance: sim = Simulator()</li>
  <li>Run the simulation (returns a dict() of the results): res = sim.runSim()</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ol>
